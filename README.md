## Usage
* First, if you do not have R or RStudio on your computer, follow the tutorial [here](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/starting.html).

* Once you have R, download the repository as a .zip file.
* Open the .rproj. Once the RStudio window is open, navigate to utils > libraries.R. Once you are on this page, ensure each dependency is installed (there should be a banner on the top which prompts the user to install them).
* Once the libraries are installed, click the Run App button on the top right of the script.
* From there, follow the prompts to initialize your class and you are up and running!
* To create a separate app for a different class, just repeat the process and save the code in a different directory.
